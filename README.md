# Fix The World One Bug at a Time

## The First Repo in the campaign for a better world through bug fixing

### Understanding what this is?

First, bugfixing is the process programmers use to fix their code before and after the release of software.

In a larger sense as we create the world we live in we are programming our world but we're doing it very fast and like building software, as we go we are creating bugs. Bugs mount up fast and become quagmires of blockage to progress, ideas and implementations. The purpose of FixTheWorldsBugs is to work together with people everywhere who want a better world to fix the bugs we've created as we've moved forward faster than the speed of information.

Bugs in the system are everywhere. For instance, the example I'll use to explain, is that we've mastered individual usage of solar power but availability of information regarding the tech and the local users regulations lag behind and block the potential for implementation for the average person. We will identify the blocks that stop the average person from implementing solar power as a viable supplement or alternative to their current power usage.

First we'll identify the elements involved in undertaking implementing solar power for your home.

Then we'll identify the bugs in the system that stop us from moving forward.

Those bugs will be converted into project issues and made available to the public

Any person can assign an issue to themselves and tackle the problem.

Once an issue is tackled and documented the user who assigned it to themselves can create what's called a Pull Request to have their solution merged into the master project.

Their solution can be anything from a spec, a document, a by-law they had changed in their community, sourcing out safer or larger capacity electric storage, any solution whether on paper or changed in the real world is an element that can be merged back into the main project until we have sourced from the world a complete solution for the average layman to implement solar power for their suburban home.
